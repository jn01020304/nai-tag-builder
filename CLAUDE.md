# Work Process Instructions

## Starting a Session — Understanding Context
The sub-project is equipped with the following notes. Read HANDOFF.md first, then follow where it points to decide which notes to read next.

- **HANDOFF.md**: Start here. What was done last session, what remains, what to do next.
- **one-pager.md**: Coding gotchas — platform API quirks, confirmed behaviors, syntax traps.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Module structure — component wiring, data flow, design rationale.
- **Changelog.md**: Version history.
- **README.md**: Project overview and quick start.
- **docs/USER_Guide.md**: End-user installation and usage guide.
- **guide/**: Archived knowledge from past sessions, organized by topic.

**Exception — Document cleanup tasks**: When the task is organizing notes (not coding), read the conversation log from the previous session first instead of HANDOFF.md.

## During a Session — Alignment Before Execution
Before writing code, present the files to be changed and the task details to the user. Execute according to the plan approved or adjusted by the user.

## Session Wrap-up
When the user sends a session termination signal ("Let's wrap up," "That's it for today," "세션 마무리," "작업 종료," etc.), use the /wrap-up skill to synchronize notes.
